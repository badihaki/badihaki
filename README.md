Hey! My name is Badi-Haki Martin, but my friends just call me Haki. I'm a Flatiron Grad where I specialized in web development with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and React. I am previously self-taught in C#, HTML and CSS.
<br />
<br />
I love to create video games and rich web apps. Right now, I'm working on a deckbuilding action game and a web app to store and view recipes from individual users for various baked goods.
